class Pronunciation:
    def __init__(self,hanzi, enums_list):
        self.hanzi = hanzi # Because this should somehow inherit the hanzi attribute from the character class?
        self.enums_list = enums_list # Because this should somehow be talking to the dialects enumerations, right?
# Honestly I have no clue what I'm doing with this class, just made it because we were told to do "microservices". Seems to me this could all be in class
